So it's been a while since I was last able to post something to this blog. A lot has happened since my last post.

First of all, I passed all of my classes. Almost all with an A, with the exception of one class that just had some poorly weighted grades that caused me to get a C in that one. But let's not talk about that. I'm looking forward to taking my new class load this semester (that starts in a few days), which should be a little more forgiving than the last one.

I have moved into a nice new HOUSE. Yes that's right, HOUSE. It is a 5 bedroom (technically) More like a 4 bedroom with a big closet. But it's a split level with a finished basement that has a bar in it. What more could you want. Plus it's only about 10 minutes from UNC Charlotte. So the location is pretty much perfect. 

<h3>Some New Year's Resolutions: </h3>
* Get less fat
* Make more money
* Do more projects (Programming or otherwise)
* Be a bit more social
* Use my giant house for what it's meant for (party!~)
* Kick this semester's ass
* Write more consistently on this blog too...

I got a job at the Charlotte Music School, which I enjoy a lot. It pays pretty well on top of being super low stress. So that is leaning in my favor. On that note I am hoping to start a small chamber music class at that job to teach kids about how to play in a chamber setting with other people. Lot's of good things to come on that front. I'm working on getting quite a few things going with the music school.

I've left my HP job because retail is unbearable. Nothing really more to say about that one.

Finally the Chamber Orchestra will be traveling to Vancouver, BC this semester around spring break time. I am super excited about that trip. It's going to be a lot of fun, mainly because it's super cheap travel, but also because I get to play lots of great music with lots of interesting people. The travel is just the icing on that cake. I will hopefully have plenty to share about that trip once it rolls around.
