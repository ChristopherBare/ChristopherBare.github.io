As you probably already know, my name is Christopher Bare. I am a Computer Science major at UNC Charlotte. I like to do the music thing too. This is a personal blog that I created so that I could try out the Jekyll framework because I heard it was good for using markdown to create simple and efficient blog. Turns out what they were saying is true. This is super nice and easy to use.

On this site you will find ramblings of things that I feel strongly enough about to sit down and write a post about. Which is saying something, because I don't often sit down to write things. But maybe this will be a good exercise for me to start having more things to write about.

<h4>Here are the links that came with the blog because someone I know will find them useful:</h4>
