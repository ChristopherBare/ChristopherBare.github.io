If I like using the platform I will continue to update the site as often as I can. I hope that whoever decides they like me enough to endure my narcissism and read my posts on here likes what I have to say. Thanks!

I’ve also realized that every day that I’m in the library in the morning, I don’t really do much work, so I can feasibly make a blog post at least twice a week. Plus more if I have something good or interesting to talk about. Which could come up I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still learning all the stuff about using markdown files. So there’s still room for improvement in that respect. As of right now, I fully intend to maintain this blog for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lots of music related things coming up soon, so I think I might write about those as they come along. I doubt anyone is actually reading this at this point, but if anyone is, the date of the Chamber Orchestra concert is: &lt;strong&gt;October 5th at 7:30pm. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are playing Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony as well as Debussy’s Children’s Corner. It’ll be a fun time for anyone who likes good music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will probably do a small piece on the history of those two pieces at some point in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

So far it seems pretty easy to just create and deploy blog posts fairly quickly. This is going to be a fun learning process, I can already tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus this will be good for me since I’m learning Ruby already in my Software Engineering class. I can just use this blog as a playground for things I might want to try out or share things that I have learned. I am considering maybe doing a post every week or maybe even a semi-daily ramble in the morning as a fun little exercise in putting out content for people to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me quite literally about 15 minutes this morning to setup this Jekyll based blog. So I think that I will want to use this platform in the future for other projects too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only current bottleneck is getting used to the liquid template language. But once I get the hang of that, this blog will get a whole lot cooler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all for now.&lt;/p&gt;

I am going to keep it here just so people can sort of see where I started in the development of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
