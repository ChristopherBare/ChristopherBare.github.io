Now that I have really learned the in's and out's of the Jekyll framework, I can have some fun with actually posting things to this GitHub Pages blog. I've also realized that every day that I'm in the library in the morning, I don't really do much work, so I can feasibly make a blog post at least twice a week. Plus more if I have something good or interesting to talk about. Which could come up I think.

I'm still learning all the stuff about using markdown files. So there's still room for improvement in that respect. As of right now, I fully intend to maintain this blog for the foreseeable future.

I have lots of music related things coming up soon, so I think I might write about those as they come along. I doubt anyone is actually reading this at this point, but if anyone is, the date of the Chamber Orchestra concert is: <strong>October 5th at 7:30pm. </strong>

We are playing Schubert's Unfinished Symphony as well as Debussy's Children's Corner. It'll be a fun time for anyone who likes good music.

I will probably do a small piece on the history of those two pieces at some point in the near future.
