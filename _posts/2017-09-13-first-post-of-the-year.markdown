This is just a post to sort of learn how this works. So far it seems pretty easy to just create and deploy blog posts fairly quickly. This is going to be a fun learning process, I can already tell.

Plus this will be good for me since I'm learning Ruby already in my Software Engineering class. I can just use this blog as a playground for things I might want to try out or share things that I have learned. I am considering maybe doing a post every week or maybe even a semi-daily ramble in the morning as a fun little exercise in putting out content for people to see.

It took me quite literally about 15 minutes this morning to setup this Jekyll based blog. So I think that I will want to use this platform in the future for other projects too.

My only current bottleneck is getting used to the liquid template language. But once I get the hang of that, this blog will get a whole lot cooler.

That's all for now.
